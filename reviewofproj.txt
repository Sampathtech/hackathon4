### Project Overview:

**Purpose:**  
The primary goal of this system is to help parents manage their children's vaccination schedules efficiently. By offering a digital solution, it simplifies the process of booking appointments, tracking upcoming vaccinations, and ensuring that no doses are missed. 

**Key Features:**
1. **Child Registration:** Parents can register their child in the system by providing the child's name and date of birth.
2. **Vaccination Scheduling:** Based on the child's date of birth, the system can schedule vaccinations for various diseases, setting appointments automatically for the correct dates.
3. **Appointment Management:** Parents can view a list of all scheduled vaccinations for their child.
4. **Reminders:** The system can send reminders on the day of the appointment to ensure parents don't miss any scheduled vaccination.

### Code Explanation:

1. **Database Connection and Initialization:**
   - The system uses SQLite to store data in a database named `vaccination_system.db`.
   - Tables `children` and `appointments` are created to store children's information and their vaccination schedules.

2. **Registering a Child (`register_child` method):**
   - This method inserts the child's name and date of birth (DOB) into the `children` table.
   - The child is uniquely identified by an `id` generated automatically by the database.

3. **Scheduling Vaccination (`schedule_vaccination` method):**
   - This method schedules a vaccination for a child.
   - It calculates the appointment date based on the number of days after the child’s birth (using the `days_after_birth` parameter).
   - The appointment date and vaccine information are stored in the `appointments` table.

4. **Fetching Appointments (`get_appointments` method):**
   - This method retrieves all scheduled vaccinations for a specific child.
   - It returns a list of vaccines along with their corresponding appointment dates.

5. **Sending Reminders (`send_reminders` method):**
   - This method checks if any vaccination appointments are scheduled for the current day.
   - If there are, it generates reminders to notify the parents.

6. **Database Cleanup:**
   - The connection to the SQLite database is closed when the `VaccinationSystem` class instance is deleted.

### Example Usage:

- **Register a Child:**  
  Registers a child named "John Doe" with the date of birth "2023-01-01."
  
- **Schedule Vaccinations:**  
  Two vaccinations are scheduled: "Hepatitis B" 30 days after birth, and "Polio" 60 days after birth.
  
- **View Appointments:**  
  Lists all scheduled vaccination appointments for "John Doe."
  
- **Send Reminders:**  
  Sends a reminder if today is the appointment date for any scheduled vaccinations.

### Conclusion:

This Child Vaccination Management System is designed to be a user-friendly tool that helps parents stay on top of their child’s vaccination schedule, ensuring that crucial immunizations are not missed. By automating appointment scheduling and sending timely reminders, the system contributes to better healthcare outcomes for children.
